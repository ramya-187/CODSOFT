## 🚀 Tasks
### 🔹 Task 1: Student Performance Analysis
- **Description:** In this task, a dataset of student marks in three subjects (Maths, Science, English) was created and analyzed using Pandas and NumPy. Descriptive statistics were computed, and a bar chart was plotted using Matplotlib to visualize subject-wise performance. This helps in identifying variations in student performance across subjects.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

### 🔹 Task 2: Iris Dataset Classification
- **Description:** In this task, the famous Iris dataset is used for classification. The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and the goal is to classify them into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. A machine learning model is trained using Scikit-learn, and visualizations are created using Seaborn.
- **Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
